# /my-build

Build the target: **$ARGUMENTS**

Implement the **task list**. Output must conform to the project's conventions — the target's **Code Style** &
**Boundaries**, `CLAUDE.md`, and surrounding code. **Verify before you commit.**

**Task list** = a spec's **Implementation Plan** / a debug artifact's **Fix Plan**.

- **Language.** Write target edits (idea write-ins, task check-offs) in **English**; for other artifacts (code,
  comments, commits, docs) follow the project's conventions; talk to the user in their configured language.
- **Source lookup.** Read/trace source: **GitNexus** (if available) → **DeepWiki** → `grep`/`find`.

## Phase 1 — Resolve the target

1. **Strip an optional `auto` or `team` token** from `$ARGUMENTS` first (they pick the run mode in Phase 2, not
   the target); the remainder is the selector. Resolve it per
   `~/.claude/references/my-workflow/resolve-target.md`.
2. **Not planned → recommend the planner first, ask before proceeding.** Judge from **content**, not the
   `Status:` line:
   - **spec** not planned (Implementation Plan still `> TODO` / no `[ ]`; or Test Plan has `TODO` / any `<…>`) →
     recommend `/my-plan`.
   - **debug artifact** not planned (Fix Plan empty/`TODO`; or Test Plan has placeholders) → recommend `/my-debug`.

## Phase 2 — Set the baseline & route skills

1. Read the target's **Design Details** — its **task list** is your ordered work.
2. **Clean git baseline:** `git status --porcelain`; unrelated uncommitted changes → ask how to handle before
   per-task commits.
3. **Be on the target's working branch** (create from default branch if not). Prefix by source:

   | Target | Branch |
   | --- | --- |
   | Feature spec (`Type: Feature`) | `spec/<title>` |
   | Bug-fix spec (`Type: Bug fix`) | `fix/<title>` |
   | Debug artifact | `fix/<title>` (always) |

   (`<title>` = hyphenated title, without the date/issue prefix.)
4. **Run mode:**

   | Mode | When | Stops |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | **Team** (parallel) | `team` token passed **and** the task list carries `Blocked by:` / `Owns:` | gated tasks + compaction (5.3) + final review (5.5) |
   | **Auto-chain** | session in `acceptEdits`/`bypassPermissions`, **or** `auto` token passed | only compaction (5.3) + final review (5.5) |
   | **Per-task confirm** (default) | every other case | pauses before each commit |

   State the chosen run mode **and** the tracking mode in your first message.

   **Team mode → read `~/.claude/references/my-workflow/team-lane.md` now and follow it in place of Phase 3's
   one-task-at-a-time sequencing.** Everything else in this command still applies. `team` passed but the task
   list has no `Blocked by:` / `Owns:` → don't improvise a DAG: say so, recommend `/my-plan` to annotate it,
   and offer per-task confirm instead.
5. **Backbone (inline discipline):** **tracer bullets**, never big-bang; drive with TDD (RED →
   GREEN → keep suite green; loop in Phase 3). **PoC/spike front-loaded?** (risky items ordered first) build it first;
   if it overturns a Goal/Feature/design, reconcile the target **now** at its source (Phase 3.5) while churn is
   cheap — keeps `/my-ship`'s history folding small.
6. **Extra skills by task nature:**

   | Task nature | Skill |
   | --- | --- |
   | Refactor (rename/extract/split/move) | `gitnexus-refactoring` **first** (if available) |
   | API / interface design | `agent-skills:api-and-interface-design` |
   | Risk item (flagged in target) | `agent-skills:doubt-driven-development` |
   | Frontend / UI | `agent-skills:frontend-ui-engineering` |
   | Rendered screenshot (render/responsive/component shot) | `crawl4ai-search` |
   | Interactive UI debug (clicks/console/network) | `agent-skills:browser-testing-with-devtools` |
7. **Confirm the build/test environment before the loop.** Read the environment the target pinned in
   **Commands** — **local or remote** (if remote, its access method); if unpinned (older/unplanned target), ask.
   **Smoke-check** the build/test commands run in that environment before starting — a broken environment found
   mid-build is expensive to unwind.

## Phase 3 — Build the next task (loop)

Do **one** pending task from the task list:

1. Read its acceptance criteria; load relevant existing code, patterns, types. On the **first** task, if
   `Status:` is still `Planned` (spec) / `Diagnosed` (debug), flip it to `Building` — saved with the task in 5.2.
2. **TDD:** failing test (RED) → minimum to pass (GREEN) → full suite (regressions) → build.
3. **Conform:** follow Code Style & Boundaries + `CLAUDE.md`; match surrounding code; run lint/format (from
   Commands).
4. **Simplicity & readability discipline (continuous, while coding — never overrides `CLAUDE.md`):**
   - **Decision ladder before writing** — need this at all? → codebase already has it? → standard library? →
     native platform feature? → an installed dependency covers it? → can it be one line? → *then* minimal
     working code. **Deletion over addition; boring over clever.**
   - **Simplify anti-patterns** — deep nesting → guard clauses / extract; long function → split by
     responsibility; nested ternary → if/else; generic names → descriptive; duplicated logic → shared function;
     dead code → remove after confirming.
   - **Never simplify away** — input validation, data-loss-preventing error handling, security, accessibility,
     explicitly requested features.
   - **Heavy/at-scale simplification** → escalate to `agent-skills:code-simplification` (in Phase 4 review or
     end-of-build).
5. **Unclear spec detail → ask the user** (don't guess). For a bounded factual question you may
   delegate it to the rescue subagent (`codex:codex-rescue` or `kimi:kimi-rescue`) — apply
   `crosscheck` (read-only, foreground, one tightly-scoped question). Keep this to **one bounded
   question**; the per-task heavy **defect review** belongs to Phase 4's heavy-review step (now run by
   codex/kimi), not here.
6. **Build changes the target?** (a new idea, or a finding that overturns a Goal / Feature / User Story / Risk)
   — confirm, then write it back **at the source** (fix the upstream statement, not just the task line). Then
   continue against the reconciled target. A **design-level** problem (the design itself overturned, not a
   task detail) → beyond the write-back, recommend returning to `/my-plan` to re-plan; if the main model was
   downshifted for the build, suggest `/model claude-fable-5` first so full reasoning is back for the re-plan.

## Phase 4 — Review & impact analysis

Depth matches the task's risk:

1. **Routine → inline self-review** on four axes: correctness (meets acceptance, edge cases), readability,
   convention conformance (Code Style / Boundaries / `CLAUDE.md` / surrounding code), security.
2. **Heavy → full review with codex/kimi.** When the task changed **exported/shared symbols**, is
   **Risk**-flagged, or is a **large change**: run **one** `/<tool>:review` over the task's working-copy
   diff (uncommitted until Phase 5) — select the toolchain per `crosscheck` (Steps 0/1.5: availability +
   `--assist` / ask-once, then reused for the rest of the build). Collect it **before committing this task**
   and reconcile per `crosscheck` Steps 7–8 (spot-check findings, **STOP and ask which to fix**, never
   auto-apply). This per-task heavy review is the **exception** to crosscheck's one-turn-per-stage ceiling
   — one review per heavy task, never concurrent. At the same threshold, if `gitnexus-impact-analysis` is
   available, run one round on the changed symbols (what depends on them, what could break).
3. Problems surfaced → address (Claude fixes them; never auto-apply the tool's suggestions) → re-verify
   (back to Phase 3).

## Phase 5 — Confirm, commit, continue

1. **Gate by run mode** once reviewed & verified:
   - **Per-task confirm** → present the task and **wait for confirmation** before committing.
   - **Auto-chain / Team** → skip the pause; commit and continue.
2. **Record → stage → commit**, in order:
   - **Record:** check off `[x]` in the task list **and advance `Status:` in the same edit** — `Building` while
     tasks remain, `Built` when this was the last.
   - **Stage:** stage only this task's files. Stage the target edit **only if committed (`specs/`)**; a **local**
     target (`.claude/specs/` or `.claude/debugs/`) is updated on disk but **never staged**.
   - **Commit with `-s`** (let `-s` append `Signed-off-by:`; never hand-write it):

     ```
     <type>(optional scope): <title in lowercase>

     - <change, one simple point per bullet>
     - ...

     Task <task index> of <target name>.
     ```
     - `type` ∈ `fix|feat|build|chore|ci|docs|style|refactor|perf|test`.
     - `<task index>` = the task's ordinal; `<target name>` = the hyphenated spec/debug title (e.g.
       `Task 3 of user-auth-flow`).
3. **Compaction checkpoint** (tasks still pending) — apply
   `~/.claude/references/my-workflow/compaction.md` (its `/my-build` row and threshold).
4. Back to Phase 3 for the next task. All done (`Status: Built`) → **summarize:** tasks completed, tests added,
   commits made, anything skipped / flagged / left for the user.
5. **End-of-build review** (all modes):
   1. **Pin the scope, fail fast.** Resolve the base and confirm `git diff <base>...HEAD` is non-empty (working
      tree if still uncommitted). A bad ref or empty diff fails here, not inside three reviewers. Team mode →
      shut teammates down first, so nothing is still writing while the reviewers read.
   2. **User review** — present an overall diff overview; ask whether anything needs adjustment (yes → Phase 3,
      then back here).
   3. **Run the two axes in parallel** — separate contexts, so neither pollutes the other:
      - **Standards** — `/agent-skills:review` over the build (correctness, readability, architecture,
        security, performance), carrying `~/.claude/references/my-workflow/smells.md` as its baseline.
      - **Spec** — the `spec-reviewer` subagent, seeded with the **target and the diff only** — never your own
        conclusions about the build. It answers the one question the five axes never ask: did we build what was
        ordered?
   4. **Kick off the cross-check (gated, background) — apply `crosscheck`.** Pre-flight
      `/<tool>:status` (no per-task rescue still in flight), then background **one** `/<tool>:review
      --scope branch` over the whole build diff. **Once, never per task.** It runs while the two axes do.
      Gate skip / neither tool available → note it and skip.
   5. **Barrier & address findings.** Collect all three (`/<tool>:status` → `/<tool>:result` for the
      cross-check). Report **Standards and Spec side by side under their own headings — never merged, never
      re-ranked across axes.** A change can pass one axis and fail the other; merging lets the clean axis mask
      the failing one. Fold the cross-check's findings into whichever axis they belong to. Spot-check large
      findings against source (`crosscheck` Step 7), then **STOP and ask the user which to fix** (never
      auto-apply), fix the real issues, and re-verify (Phase 3) before finalizing.
6. **Ask whether to run `/my-ship` now.** If yes, continue into `/my-ship` with this target.
